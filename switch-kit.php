                            Our Customer Service Representatives (CSRs) are eager to guide you through the process of switching to Swiss 
                            Apex Private Bank. The process begins when you <a href="apply.html" style="color: blue;">open a new account</a> with SAPB. Once established, then your direct depositors and 
                            automatic payees should each be properly authorized to initiate direct deposits and/or automatic payments to your account(s).
                            <br><br>
                            Our CSRs are willing to help you telephone the Social Security Administration or other U.S. government agency 
                            that will work with us. While you are at the bank and in our presence, we can telephone the paying agency 
                            to request them to initiate the process of switching your direct deposit to your new SAPB account. If your 
                            direct deposit is from your employer, a pension or a private company we can also assist you in completing 
                            the specific form your company may require.
                        </p>

                <p>
                    Automatic payments for recurring payments such as utility bills, insurance premiums or other monthly 
                    expenses are also very popular. Should you want to establish or switch an automatic payment from your 
                    new account then at your request, we can assist you in this process. SAPB offers a SWITCH KIT that you 
                    may use in the event your depositor or payee does not require a specific form. <br><br>
                    
                    Whether you use the agency required forms or the switch kit form provided above, we are ready and willing to 
                    assist you in completing the required documentation. You may just have a question or two about our bank identification 
                    numbers. Whatever your need we are ready to respond to your questions. Just gather all the information required by the 
                    company and bring the form in to any branch and speak to a CSR. Switching banks doesn’t have to a hassle when you have 
                    the right bank. We’re here to help!
