                        <h2>Health Savings Account (HSA)</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>A Health Savings Account (HSA) from Swiss Apex Private Bank is a great way to save for your 
                        health care expenses while taking advantage of tax savings. If you qualify, then an HSA offers these benefits:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tax-deductible contributions and distributions</li>
                            <li>Owned by the individual</li>
                            <li>No Monthly maintenance fees</li>
                            <li>Carry unused balances forward from year to year and earn interest tax-free</li>
                            <li>Earn a competitive <a href="rates.html" style="color: blue;">interest rate or Annual Percentage Yield(APY)</a></li>
                            <li>And much more...</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Whether you qualify for an HSA, depends on your health insurance coverage. You must be covered under an 
                            HSA-eligible high deductible health plan (HDHP) to contribute to an HSA. An HDHP generally requires that you pay 
                            out of pocket for medical expenses incurred (excluding certain preventive care expenses) until your deductible is met. 
                            Plan coverage kicks in after that. You should check with your insurance provider or employer who can clarify the rules 
                            that define an HSA-eligible 
                            HDHP and to see if your health plan is HSA eligible. In addition to having HSA eligible HDHP coverage, you:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cannot be covered by another health plan</li>
                            <li>Cannot be enrolled in Medicare, and</li>
                            <li>Cannot be eligible to be claimed as a dependent on another person’s tax return.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            At Swiss Apex Private Bank, a Health Savings Account may be opened with a minimum deposit of only $100. We offer 
                            both Self-only and Family coverage plans. A Free Instant Issue Debit MasterCard or personalized checks may 
                            be obtained so that you may make qualified payments from your HSA account directly to your health care providers. <br><br>
                            For more information about an HSA account , please contact one of our Customer Service Representatives. You should 
                            also consult with your health care insurance provider to see if you qualify and with your tax professional for 
                            tax compliance advice. Swiss Apex Private Bank does not sell health insurance directly to the public or provide advice on 
                            health coverage. Swiss Apex Private Bank does not provide tax preparation service or advice on tax matters.

                        The interest rate and Annual Percentage Yield (APY) are subject to change weekly.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Balance Computation Method: We use the daily balance method to calculate the interest on your account. 
                                This method applies the daily periodic rate to the principal in the account on each day. Interest is paid (credited) 
                                and compounded monthly, except for Regular Savings which is paid (credited) and compounded quarterly.</li>
                            <li>Accrual: Interest begins to accrue no later than the day we 
                                receive full credit for the deposit of non-cash items (for example checks)</li>
                            <li>All interest bearing accounts are variable rate accounts. We may change the rate at our discretion.</li>
                            <li>If you close your account before interest is credited, you will receive interest only if you notify us at the time of closing. 
                                If you do not tell us you are closing your account you will not receive your accrued interest.</li>
                            <li>Effect of Fees: fees may reduce earnings.</li>
                        </ul>
