                            Low rates. Local service. Worldwide access.  These are a few advantages a MasterCard credit 
                            card from Swiss Apex Private Bank has over an out-of-state credit card company. Many credit 
                            cards employ a "bait and switch" tactic to lure you with a low "introductory" rate then raise 
                            your rate after a few months. But the trusted lenders SAPB offer you a consistently competitive 
                            rate and personal service with bankers you may speak with in person at a local branch. <br><br>
                            Another SAPB advantage is that you can make your payments at the branch, online or 
                            by mail. Local service also means you can speak to your SAPB loan officer should 
                            you need to increase your credit line.
