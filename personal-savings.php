                        <h2>Health Savings Account (HSA)</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        A Health Savings Account (HSA) from Horizon Trustco Bank is a great way to save for your health care expenses 
                        while taking advantage of tax savings. If you qualify, then an HSA offers these benefits:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tax-deductible contributions and distributions</li>
                            <li>Owned by the individual</li>
                            <li>No Monthly maintenance fees</li>
                            <li>Carry unused balances forward from year to year and earn interest tax-free</li>
                            <li>And much more...</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Whether you qualify for an HSA, depends on your health insurance coverage. You must be covered under 
                            an HSA-eligible high deductible health plan (HDHP) to contribute to an HSA. An HDHP generally requires 
                            that you pay out of pocket for medical expenses incurred (excluding certain preventive care expenses) until 
                            your deductible is met. Plan coverage kicks in after that. You should check with your insurance provider or 
                            employer who can clarify the rules that define an HSA-eligible HDHP 
                            and to see if your health plan is HSA eligible. In addition to having HSA eligible HDHP coverage, you:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cannot be covered by another health plan</li>
                            <li>Cannot be enrolled in Medicare, and</li>
                            <li>Cannot be eligible to be claimed as a dependent on another personâ€™s tax return.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            At Horizon Trustco Bank, a Health Savings Account may be opened with a minimum deposit of only $100. We offer 
                            both Self-only and Family coverage plans. A Free Instant Issue Debit MasterCard or personalized checks may be 
                            obtained so that you may make qualified payments from your HSA account directly to your health care providers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For more information about an HSA account , please contact one of our Customer Service Representatives. You should 
                            also consult with your health care insurance provider to see if you qualify and with your tax professional for 
                            tax compliance advice. Horizon Trustco Bank does not sell health insurance directly to the public or provide advice on health 
                            coverage. Horizon Trustco Bank does not provide tax preparation service or advice on tax matters. <br><br>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Balance Computation Method: We use the daily balance method to calculate the interest on your account. This method 
                                applies the daily periodic rate to the principal in the account on each day. Interest is paid (credited) 
                                and compounded monthly, except for Regular Savings which is paid (credited) and compounded quarterly.</li>
                            <li>Accrual: Interest begins to accrue no 
                                later than the day we receive full credit for the deposit of non-cash items (for example checks)</li>
                            <li>All interest bearing accounts are variable rate accounts. We may change the rate at our discretion.</li>
                            <li>If you close your account before interest is credited, you will receive interest only if you notify us at the time 
                                of closing. If you do not tell us you are closing your account you will not receive your accrued interest.</li>
                            <li>Effect of Fees: fees may reduce earnings.</li>
