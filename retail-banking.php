                            Online Banking will enable you to manage finances, transfer funds, set stop payments, and 
                            more, all from the convenience of your desktop or mobile device. Take control of your cash flow by using Online 
                            Banking to send payment for bills, taxes and other expenses. Online Bill Pay can reduce or 
                            eliminate manually written paper checks.  For your vendors that may not accept online payments, you may initiate paper checks 
                            via your online bill pay dashboard that will be sent by U.S. Mail, thus saving postage and other expenses. <br><br>

                            Remote Deposit:  Spend less time depositing checks and more time running your business. 
                            Remote Deposit Capture allows you to make deposits to your account from 
                            your home or office.

                    Merchant Services - Accepting Credit and Debit cards (MasterCard, Visa, etc.) at your business is essential in today’s 
                    retail world. Many people no longer carry checks so your customers will appreciate the convenience that debit and credit 
                    cards provide. From a business standpoint, it pays to accept cards because the average purchase tends to be higher when a 
                    customer pays with their debit/credit card, rather than with cash or checks. Therefore, acceptance of cards can 
                    significantly increase your sales. Email Us or come in to a SAPB branch and speak to a Customer Service Representative to 
                    learn how you can add a low-cost processing solution that fully satisfies the needs of you and your customers.
