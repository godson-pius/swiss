                        If you own or operate a business, it pays to accept credit and debit cards. Most of your customers will 
                        appreciate the convenience that debit and credit cards provide. Many people no longer carry checks. 
                        The average purchase tends to be higher when your customer pays with their debit/credit card, rather 
                        than with cash or checks, thus increasing your sales. Our merchant credit/debit card vendor can provide 
                        equipment and service for debit/credit card acceptance payment for most any operating environment. 
                        You will also receive competitive rates and pricing on equipment. <br><br>
                        For more information on Merchant Card Payment Service or to get started contact us or call info@swissapexprivateb.com. 
                        Ask one of Customer Service Representatives for more about how you can accept cards as payment in your business.

                        Low rates, local service with worldwide access are advantages that a credit card from Swiss Apex Private 
                        Bank has over an out-of-state credit card company. Many credit cards may offer you a low "introductory" rate 
                        then raise your rate after a few months. But SAPB offers you a consistently low rate MasterCard. At SAPB you also 
                        have the many advantages of local bank service. Local service means that you make your payments right here at SAPB. 
                        Local service also means you can speak to your SAPB loan officer when you need to increase your credit line. <br><br>
                        You can shop locally or travel the world and with your MasterCard issued from Swiss Apex Private Bank. 
                        Call today and speak with one of our loan officers for complete details about the local credit card with worldwide access.

                        Some credit cards may also be able to get cash at our ATMs. This ATM access is dependent on how the issuer of your
